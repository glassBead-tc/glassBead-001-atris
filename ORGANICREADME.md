# Organic README for AI Collaboration

This document serves as a "state" tracker for our AI-assisted development process. It helps maintain consistency across interactions and reduces confusion.


## Strategies for Effective Collaboration

1. **Consistent Terminology**: Establish a shared vocabulary for key concepts.

2. **Summarization**: Periodically summarize the current state of the problem or discussion.

3. **Explicit State Tracking**: Maintain a list of key facts, decisions, or assumptions, updating as we go.

4. **Incremental Problem Solving**: Break down complex issues into smaller, manageable steps.

5. **Clear Delineation**: Clearly indicate when switching topics or aspects of the problem.

6. **Explicit Corrections**: Correct mistakes or misunderstandings explicitly, asking for confirmation.

7. **Asking for Recaps**: Request recaps of the current project or problem state to surface misunderstandings.

8. **Documentation References**: Consistently refer to specific documentation or resources for library-specific issues.

## Project State

### Goals and Constraints
- [List project goals and constraints here]

### Key Decisions
- [List important decisions made during development]

### Current Challenges

## Notes
- This document should be updated regularly during our interactions to maintain a consistent understanding of the project.
- Refer to this document when starting new sessions or when confusion arises.

## Notes to Assistant

When I indicate the end of a session, please simulate a a model temperature of 1 and write 14 words in a note below. There are no linguistic or context restrictions to what the 14 words are. We will track these over time.
