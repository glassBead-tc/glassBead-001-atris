This folder (langgraph-agent/ai-assistant-context) contains context from other projects for the AI assistant's ease of access. Currently, the files are:

- trimmed_corpus.json (dataset, a large collection of API's)
- langtool_diagram.png (diagram of the agent's logical and expected workflow)
- langtool.ts (interfaces for the data in trimmed_corpus.json)

These files are from the repo for Brace Sproul's LangGraph.js demo on YouTube for "Langtool," a
multi-tool agent that can intelligently choose which API's to choose for a given query. The
setup of his project is very similar to the one we will be using here.
