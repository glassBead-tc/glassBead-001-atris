## Audius Research Agent (Atris, no UI)  

[Previous content remains unchanged]

### Current Progress (as of [current date])

We have successfully expanded the functionality of the Audius Research Agent. Here's what we've achieved:

1. User query interpretation: The agent can understand and process a wider range of user queries about Audius data.
2. API selection: Based on the query, the agent correctly selects the appropriate Audius API endpoint.
3. API request execution: The agent successfully makes requests to various Audius API endpoints.
4. Data retrieval: We are able to fetch and display data from the Audius API for tracks, playlists, and trending content.
5. Data formatting: The agent now formats the results into user-friendly output for various types of queries.

Current Task:
We have implemented multiple API endpoints including "Search Tracks", "Get Trending Tracks", "Search Playlists", and "Get Playlist". The agent can now provide specific answers to queries about track information, playlist details, and trending content.

Next steps:
1. Improve error handling for failed queries and unexpected API responses.
2. Refine output formatting to eliminate duplicate or fragmented answers.
3. Implement user input handling to allow for a wider range of dynamic queries.
4. Consider adding more detailed information in the formatted output when appropriate.
5. Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequently requested data.
6. Begin work on the Next.js UI to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent.
7. Address the deprecation warning for the `punycode` module.
