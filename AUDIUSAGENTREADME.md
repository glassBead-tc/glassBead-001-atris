## Audius Research Agent (Atris, no UI)  

[Previous content remains unchanged]

### Current Progress (as of [current date])

We have implemented the basic structure of the Audius Research Agent, but are facing significant challenges:

1. API connectivity: The agent is unable to successfully connect to the Audius API.
2. Error handling: There are issues with processing API responses and handling errors.
3. Query processing: The agent is failing to select appropriate APIs for user queries.

Current Task:
Debug and fix the issues preventing successful API connections and query processing. This includes addressing the "No APIs passed to select_api_node" error and improving error handling throughout the application.

Next steps:
1. Debug and fix API connectivity issues.
2. Improve error handling for failed queries and API responses.
3. Fix the API selection process in the `select_api.ts` file.
4. Implement proper response parsing for successful API calls.
5. Continue to refine the query interpretation and response generation.
6. Implement user input handling to allow for a wider range of dynamic queries.
7. Begin work on the Next.js UI to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent.
8. Address the deprecation warning for the `punycode` module.
9. Expand the test suite to cover more edge cases and ensure consistent output.
