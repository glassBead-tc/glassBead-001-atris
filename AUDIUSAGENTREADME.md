## Audius Research Agent (Atris, no UI)  

[Previous content remains unchanged]

### Current Progress (as of [current date])

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the Audius Research Agent. Here's what we've achieved:

1. User query interpretation: The agent can understand and process user queries about Audius data.
2. API selection: Based on the query, the agent correctly selects the appropriate Audius API endpoint.
3. API request execution: The agent successfully makes requests to the Audius API.
4. Data retrieval: We are able to fetch and display data from the Audius API, specifically trending tracks information.

Current Task:
We are now conducting a series of test queries for each of our implemented endpoints. This will help us verify the functionality of our agent across different types of requests and ensure that it can handle various user queries correctly.

Next steps:
1. Complete test queries for all implemented endpoints.
2. Analyze the results of these tests and identify any areas for improvement.
3. Implement more robust error handling and edge case management based on test results.
4. Expand the agent's capabilities to handle a wider range of queries and API endpoints.
5. Develop post-processing functionality to present the data in a more user-friendly format.
6. Consider implementing the human-in-the-loop verification step for more complex queries.
