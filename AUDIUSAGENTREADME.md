## Audius Research Agent (Atris, no UI)  

[Previous content remains unchanged]

### Current Progress (as of [current date])

We have successfully implemented the core functionality of the Audius Research Agent. Here's what we've achieved:

1. User query interpretation: The agent can understand and process user queries about Audius data.
2. API selection: Based on the query, the agent correctly selects the appropriate Audius API endpoint.
3. API request execution: The agent successfully makes requests to the Audius API.
4. Data retrieval: We are able to fetch and display data from the Audius API, specifically for searching tracks.
5. Data formatting: The agent now formats the search results into a user-friendly output, providing specific answers to queries about track information.

Current Task:
We have completed the implementation of the "Search Tracks" endpoint and successfully formatted the output. The agent can now provide specific answers to queries about track information, such as identifying the artist of a particular track.

Next steps:
1. Implement more API endpoints to expand the agent's capabilities.
2. Improve error handling and edge case management for various API responses.
3. Implement user input handling to allow for a wider range of dynamic queries.
4. Consider adding more detailed track information in the formatted output when appropriate.
5. Implement caching mechanisms to improve response times for frequently requested data.
6. Begin work on the Next.js UI to provide a user-friendly interface for interacting with the agent.
