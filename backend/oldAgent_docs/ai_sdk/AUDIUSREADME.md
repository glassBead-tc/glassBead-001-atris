# Audius Agent Implementation

## Work Completed

1. Created a basic structure for the Audius agent in `audiusAgent.ts`.
2. Implemented a query router in `queryRouter.ts` to determine if a query is Audius-specific or general.
3. Updated the main `page.tsx` component to use both the Audius agent and the general agent based on the query type.
4. Defined an `AudiusAPITool` class as a LangChain tool for interacting with the Audius API.
5. Implemented the actual API call logic in the `AudiusAPITool`:
   - Added methods for searching and retrieving tracks, artists, and playlists.
   - Implemented error handling for API calls.
6. Created an API route (`/api/audius`) to handle Audius SDK calls server-side.
7. Updated `audiusData.ts` to use the new API route instead of direct SDK calls, resolving compilation issues.
8. Implemented streaming responses using Vercel's AI SDK.
9. Set up basic structure for using LangGraph.js for agent workflows.
10. Implemented the `runAudiusAgent` function in `audiusAgentServer.ts`:
    - Created a wrapper that adapts ChatOpenAI to the LanguageModelV1 interface.
    - Integrated the AudiusAPITool with the agent.
    - Implemented error handling and environment variable checks.
11. Updated and passed unit tests for the Audius agent implementation.
12. Refined the agent implementation to handle more complex queries.
13. Improved error handling and edge cases in the `runAudiusAgent` function.
14. Implemented fallback mechanisms for when the agent encounters unexpected situations.
15. Added additional unit tests for edge cases and complex scenarios.
16. Performed integration testing to ensure smooth interaction between components.
17. Added inline comments to explain complex parts of the code, especially in agent workflows.
18. Optimized API calls and agent decision-making processes for better performance.
19. Implemented better loading states and error messages for Audius-related queries.
20. Conducted a security review to ensure proper management of API keys and secrets.

## Remaining Tasks

1. Enhance the Audius agent implementation:
   - Further refine the prompt template to better guide the agent in using the Audius API tool.
   - Implement more complex, multi-step query handling using LangGraph.js.

2. Testing and validation:
   - Continue to test agent performance with various query complexities.

3. Documentation:
   - Create user documentation explaining how to use the Audius-specific features and agent capabilities.

4. UI/UX improvements:
   - Consider adding a visual interface for tracking agent decision-making processes.

5. Implement retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) with agents:
   - Integrate Supabase as a vector store for RAG capabilities.
   - Develop agent workflows that incorporate RAG for answering complex questions about Audius content.

6. Extend agent functionality:
   - Implement agent-based trending content queries.

By completing these remaining tasks, we'll have a fully functional and robust system that leverages advanced agent capabilities to handle both Audius-specific queries and general questions, providing a seamless and intelligent experience for users interacting with the Audius platform through our chatbot interface.
