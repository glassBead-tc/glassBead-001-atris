<!--
   Recommendation
   Given that the SDK is designed to handle all interactions with the Audius API efficiently and is maintained by the Audius team, it would be best to refactor your codebase to use only the SDK.
   Refactoring Plan
   Audit the Codebase:
   Identify all instances where manual API configurations and calls are being used.
   List out the endpoints and functionalities covered by your custom implementation.
   Map Custom Implementations to SDK Methods:
   For each custom API call in audiusApi.ts, find the equivalent method in the SDK.
   Ensure that all functionalities you require are supported by the SDK.
   Refactor API Calls:
   Replace manual API calls with the corresponding SDK methods.
   Update any custom logic that was handling parameters, error handling, or response parsing to align with the SDK's mechanisms.
   Remove Redundant Configurations:
   Delete audiusApiConfig.ts, audius_corpus.json, and any other files related to manual API configuration.
   Ensure that any documentation or comments are updated to reflect the use of the SDK.
   Update Import Paths:
   Adjust import statements throughout the codebase to import functions and classes from the SDK rather than your custom modules.
   Adjust Utility Functions:
   Review utility functions in your tools directory that might be parsing responses or handling errors.
   If the SDK provides built-in handling for these cases, consider removing or updating your utility functions accordingly.
   Testing:
   Thoroughly test all functionalities to ensure that replacing manual implementations with the SDK does not introduce any regressions.
   Pay special attention to edge cases and error handling.
   Performance Considerations:
   Benchmark the application before and after refactoring to ensure that performance has not degraded.
   The SDK is likely optimized, but it's good practice to verify.
   Documentation:
   Update your project's documentation to reflect the changes.
   Provide guidelines for other developers on how to use the SDK within your project.

# Codebase Audit

## Overview

This document provides an audit of our current codebase with the goal of refactoring it to fully utilize the Audius SDK. By leveraging the SDK, we can simplify our code, improve maintainability, and ensure compatibility with the latest updates to the Audius API. The primary focus is on the four main files driving our application: `index.ts`, `tools.ts`, `types.ts`, and `constants.ts`.

---

## Areas for SDK Integration

### 1. **`backend/src/app/tools/tools.ts`**

#### Current Implementation:

- **Manual API Calls:**
  - Functions like `callAudiusAPI` construct API URLs manually and perform HTTP requests using `fetch`.
  - The `searchEntity` function interacts with the Audius API by building parameters and parsing responses manually.

#### Potential Improvements:

- **Replace Manual API Calls with SDK Methods:**
  - Use the Audius SDK's built-in methods for API interactions.
  - For example, replace `callAudiusAPI` with the SDK's client methods.

- **Example SDK Usage:**
  ```typescript
  import Audius from '@audius/sdk';

  // Initialize the Audius client
  const sdk = new Audius({
    appName: 'YourAppName',
  });

  // Use the SDK method to search for tracks
  const tracks = await sdk.tracks.searchTracks({
    query: '115 SECONDS OF CLAMS',
  });  ```

- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies the code by removing manual URL construction and error handling.
  - Ensures consistent handling of API changes and deprecations.

### 2. **`backend/src/app/index.ts`**

#### Current Implementation:

- **Custom Graph and State Management:**
  - Manually manages state transitions and calls custom functions for each node in the graph.
  - Uses custom logic to parse responses and handle errors.

#### Potential Improvements:

- **Integrate SDK in State Graph Nodes:**
  - Replace custom API interaction within graph nodes with SDK methods.
  - Update nodes like `search_entity_node`, `execute_request_node`, and `format_response_node` to utilize the SDK.

- **Example Refactoring:**
  ```typescript
  import { sdk } from './sdkClient'; // Import the initialized SDK client

  // In the searchEntity function
  export async function searchEntity(state: GraphState): Promise<Partial<GraphState>> {
    const { trackTitle, artistName } = state.parameters;

    // Use SDK to search for tracks
    const { data: tracks } = await sdk.tracks.searchTracks({
      query: trackTitle,
      limit: 10,
    });

    // Rest of the logic remains similar
  }  ```

- **Benefits:**
  - Simplifies the function by leveraging SDK's built-in methods.
  - Reduces boilerplate code for handling requests and parsing responses.

### 3. **`backend/src/app/types.ts`**

#### Current Implementation:

- **Custom Type Definitions:**
  - Defines interfaces for `TrackData`, `UserData`, `PlaylistData`, etc.
  - Manually maintains types that may overlap with SDK's types.

#### Potential Improvements:

- **Use SDK Types:**
  - Import type definitions directly from the Audius SDK.
  - Replace custom interfaces with SDK-provided types to ensure consistency.

- **Example Refactoring:**
  ```typescript
  import { Track, User, Playlist } from '@audius/sdk';

  export type TrackData = Track;
  export type UserData = User;
  export type PlaylistData = Playlist;  ```

- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures type consistency across the application.
  - Reduces maintenance overhead for custom types.

### 4. **`backend/src/app/constants.ts`**

#### Current Implementation:

- **Manual Constants Definitions:**
  - Defines enums for `Genre`, `Mood`, `StemCategory`, etc.
  - Manually updates values as needed.

#### Potential Improvements:

- **Use SDK Constants:**
  - Utilize any constants or enums provided by the SDK.
  - If SDK provides genre or mood lists, import and use them directly.

- **Example Refactoring:**
  ```typescript
  import { Genres, Moods } from '@audius/sdk';

  export const GENRES = Genres;
  export const MOODS = Moods;  ```

- **Benefits:**
  - Ensures consistency with the Audius platform.
  - Automatically updates when the SDK is updated.

## Mapping Custom Implementations to SDK Methods

### A. **Track Operations**

- **Search Tracks:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Uses `callAudiusAPI` with `/v1/tracks/search`.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.tracks.searchTracks({ query, limit, offset })`

- **Get Track by ID:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manually constructs API call.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.tracks.getTrack({ id })`

### B. **User Operations**

- **Search Users:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call to `/v1/users/search`.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.users.searchUsers({ query, limit, offset })`

- **Get User by ID:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.users.getUser({ id })`

### C. **Playlist Operations**

- **Search Playlists:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call to `/v1/playlists/search`.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.playlists.searchPlaylists({ query, limit, offset })`

- **Get Playlist by ID:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.playlists.getPlaylist({ id })`

### D. **Trending Tracks and Playlists**

- **Get Trending Tracks:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.tracks.getTrendingTracks({ genre, timeRange, limit, offset })`

- **Get Trending Playlists:**
  - **Custom Implementation:** Manual API call.
  - **SDK Method:** `sdk.playlists.getTrendingPlaylists({ limit, offset })`

## Refactoring Plan

1. **Initialize the Audius SDK Client:**
   - Create a single instance of the SDK client, possibly in a separate module (`sdkClient.ts`), to be imported where needed.
   ```typescript
   // sdkClient.ts
   import Audius from '@audius/sdk';

   export const sdk = new Audius({
     appName: 'YourAppName',
   });   ```

2. **Update API Calls in `tools.ts`:**
   - Replace `callAudiusAPI` and related functions with SDK methods.
   - Adjust functions like `searchEntity`, `extractParameters`, etc., to use the SDK.

3. **Adjust State Graph Nodes in `index.ts`:**
   - Modify nodes that interact with the Audius API to use the SDK.
   - Ensure that error handling and state updates are consistent with the SDK's responses.

4. **Replace Custom Types in `types.ts`:**
   - Import and use types from the SDK.
   - Remove or update custom type definitions that duplicate SDK types.

5. **Use SDK Constants in `constants.ts`:**
   - Import any available constants from the SDK.
   - Remove manual definitions where applicable.

6. **Testing and Validation:**
   - Thoroughly test each updated function to ensure it behaves as expected.
   - Check for any changes in response structures or error handling.

7. **Update Documentation and Comments:**
   - Revise code comments to reflect the use of the SDK.
   - Update any documentation that references manual API interactions.

---

## Additional Considerations

- **Error Handling:**
  - The SDK provides its own error handling mechanisms.
  - Review how errors are thrown and caught, and adjust application logic accordingly.

- **Rate Limiting and Throttling:**
  - Ensure that the application respects any rate limits imposed by the Audius API.
  - The SDK may provide built-in support for handling rate limits.

- **Asynchronous Operations:**
  - The SDK methods are asynchronous and return Promises.
  - Ensure all SDK calls are awaited properly, and update any related asynchronous logic.

- **Deprecations and Updates:**
  - Stay informed about updates to the SDK to leverage new features and handle deprecations.
  - Regularly update the SDK to the latest version.

---

## Summary

By refactoring our codebase to utilize the Audius SDK, we can greatly simplify our application code, improve maintainability, and ensure compatibility with the latest API changes. The four main files—`index.ts`, `tools.ts`, `types.ts`, and `constants.ts`—can be significantly streamlined by replacing manual implementations with SDK methods and types. This transition will enhance our development workflow and position our application for future growth and scalability.
