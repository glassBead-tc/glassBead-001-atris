# Plan for Full NLP Implementation in Tools

## Objective
Enhance the NLP capabilities of our tools to reliably process queries about any property of any entity (track, user, or playlist), with particular focus on handling colloquial and informal language patterns.

## Plan

1. **Review and Update `propertyMap.ts`**
   - **Complete Property Lists**: Ensure `entityPropertyMap` includes all relevant properties for each entity type.
   - **Synonym Mapping**: Expand the mapping to include synonyms or alternative phrasings that users might use.

2. **Integrate NLP Libraries**
   - **Natural.js**: 
     - Tokenization for informal text
     - Stemming to handle word variations
     - Fuzzy matching for misspellings
   - **compromise**: 
     - Handle contractions and slang
     - Parse informal sentence structures
     - Identify entities in casual text
   - **sentiment-analysis**: 
     - Understand emotional context
     - Handle emoji and internet slang

3. **Handle Common Language Patterns**
   - **Text Normalization**:
     ```typescript
     // Examples of patterns to handle
     "whats" -> "what is"
     "gimme" -> "give me"
     "tryna" -> "trying to"
     "u" -> "you"
     "rn" -> "right now"
     ```
   - **Emoji Processing**:
     ```typescript
     // Convert emoji to meaningful text
     "ðŸ”¥" -> "popular/trending"
     "ðŸ‘€" -> "looking for"
     "ðŸ’¯" -> "top/best"
     ```
   - **Internet Slang**:
     ```typescript
     // Common abbreviations
     "tbh" -> "to be honest"
     "idk" -> "i don't know"
     "ngl" -> "not going to lie"
     ```

4. **Query Pattern Recognition**
   - **Common Structures**:
     ```typescript
     // Example patterns
     "yo who made this track" -> "Who is the artist of this track?"
     "this song is fire how many plays" -> "How many plays does this track have?"
     "whos listening to" -> "How many plays does {track} have?"
     ```
   - **Context Handling**:
     ```typescript
     // Handle implicit context
     "more like this" -> "Find similar tracks to {last_track}"
     "play the next one" -> "Play the next track in {current_playlist}"
     ```

5. **Library-Specific Implementations**

   a. **Natural.js Integration**:
   ```typescript
   import natural from 'natural';
   
   const tokenizer = new natural.WordTokenizer();
   const stemmer = natural.PorterStemmer;
   
   function normalizeQuery(query: string): string {
     // Tokenize and stem words
     const tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(query);
     return tokens.map(token => stemmer.stem(token)).join(' ');
   }
   ```

   b. **Compromise Integration**:
   ```typescript
   import nlp from 'compromise';
   
   function extractEntities(query: string) {
     const doc = nlp(query);
     return {
       people: doc.people().text(),
       places: doc.places().text(),
       organizations: doc.organizations().text()
     };
   }
   ```

6. **Fallback Mechanisms**
   - **LLM Integration**:
     - Use LLM for queries that can't be parsed by rule-based systems
     - Train LLM on common informal patterns
     - Use LLM to generate alternative phrasings
   - **User Feedback Loop**:
     - Track failed queries
     - Learn from user corrections
     - Update pattern matching based on usage

7. **Testing and Validation**
   - **Real-World Query Dataset**:
     - Collect actual user queries
     - Include various writing styles
     - Cover multiple languages/dialects
   - **Performance Metrics**:
     - Track successful parse rate
     - Measure response accuracy
     - Monitor processing time

## Implementation Priority
1. Basic text normalization
2. Library integration
3. Pattern recognition
4. Fallback mechanisms
5. User feedback system

## Success Metrics
- Handle 90%+ of informal queries correctly
- Process queries within 100ms
- Reduce LLM fallback usage to <10% of queries
