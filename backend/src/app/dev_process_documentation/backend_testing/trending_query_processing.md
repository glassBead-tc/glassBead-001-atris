# Plan to Resolve Timeout Issue with Trending Tracks Query

## Objective
Fix the timeout issue encountered when fetching trending tracks from the Audius API.

## Plan

1. **Review Audius API Documentation**
   - **Endpoint Verification**: Confirm that we're using the correct endpoint for fetching trending tracks.
     - *Completed*: Verified at [Audius Get Trending Tracks API](https://docs.audius.org/developers/api/get-trending-tracks).
   - **Parameter Requirements**: Identify required and optional parameters (`genre`, `time`, etc.).
     - *Completed*: Implementation aligns with the expected `GetTrendingTracksRequest` interface.

2. **Analyze Current API Call in `createFetchRequestTool`**
   - **Parameter Alignment**: Ensure that the parameters (`genre`, `time`) match the API's expected values.
     - *Completed*: Implementation aligns with the API requirements.
   - **Request Structure**: Verify that the request is correctly structured and all query parameters are properly encoded.
     - *Completed*: Verified through testing.
   - **Logging**: Add detailed logging to record the request and response for debugging purposes.
     - *Completed*: Existing logging in `createFetchRequestTool` is sufficient.

3. **Test API Call Independently**
   - **Manual Testing**: Use tools like Postman or cURL to make the API call with the same parameters.
     - *Completed*: API call has been tested and verified independently with Postman and Audius's documentation.
   - **Endpoint Responsiveness**: Determine if the API endpoint itself is responsive or if the issue is on the server side.
     - *Completed*: Endpoint is responsive based on manual tests.
   - **Parameter Values**: Experiment with different parameter values to see if certain values cause the timeout.
     - *Completed*: Parameter values have been tested without causing timeouts.

4. **Adjust Timeout Settings**
   - **Increase Timeout Duration**: Modify the timeout setting in the code to allow more time for the API to respond.
     - *Completed*: Timeout is already set to 10 seconds with retry logic implemented.
   - **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff in case of transient network issues.
     - *Completed*: Retry logic with exponential backoff is implemented in `createFetchRequestTool`.

5. **Handle Optional Parameters Appropriately**
   - **Default Values**: Ensure that default values are provided for optional parameters when they are not specified.
     - *Completed*: Valid defaults are provided for optional parameters.
   - **Parameter Validation**: Validate parameter values before making the API call (e.g., `time` should be one of `'week'`, `'month'`, `'allTime'`).
     - *Completed*: Parameters are validated before making the API call.

6. **Update API Client or SDK**
   - **Version Compatibility**: Check if the Audius SDK version being used is compatible with the API.
     - *Completed*: The SDK is the newest stable version available.
   - **Library Updates**: Update the SDK to the latest version if necessary.
     - *Completed*: SDK has been updated to the latest stable version.

7. **Monitor Network and Environment**
   - **Network Issues**: Verify that there are no local network issues causing the timeout.
     - *Completed*: No local network issues; other queries are functioning correctly.
   - **Environment Variables**: Ensure that all necessary environment variables (e.g., API keys) are correctly set.
     - *Completed*: Environment variables are correctly configured.

8. **Re-run and Verify**
   - **Application Testing**: Run the application and test the trending tracks query after making adjustments.
     - *Pending*: Will be performed after implementing remaining steps.
   - **Output Verification**: Confirm that the output is as expected and that the timeout issue is resolved.
     - *Pending*: To be verified post adjustments.

9. **Improve Error Handling**
   - **User Feedback**: Provide informative messages to the user if the API call fails.
     - *Pending*: To be implemented.
   - **Exception Handling**: Catch exceptions and handle them gracefully to prevent the application from crashing.
     - *Pending*: To be enhanced.

10. **Document Changes**
    - **Code Comments**: Add comments to the code explaining any significant changes.
      - *Pending*: To be done.
    - **Readme Updates**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the adjustments made.
      - *Pending*: To be updated.

## Expected Outcome
By following this plan, we should identify and fix the cause of the timeout issue, allowing the application to successfully fetch and display trending tracks from the Audius API.
