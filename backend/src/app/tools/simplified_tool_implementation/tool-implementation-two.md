## Tool Implementation: Simplified Structure


I am refactoring the tool implementation to be less modular and more straightforward, utilizing LangGraph.js's built-in features to handle the input/output schema, state management, and tool calling generally. My previous implementation was intended to be more scalable and extensible, but that implementation also created more headaches than it was worth in terms of debugging and type consistency, without the benefits of a truly agentic approach. Utilizing a highly detailed, deterministic graph structure was the worst of both worlds, yielding a lot of complexity and bugs without the dev time or user experience benefits of offloading some of the work to the LLM.


## Tool Implementation: Graph Structure

The following is my current graph structure and initialization, which I swiped from Brace Sproul's LangGraph.js implementation of the [Anytool agent](https://github.com/bracesproul/langtool-template). That project is not much leaner than the minimum required implementation for Atris, and given the large amount of code I've already written for the Atris agent, it makes sense to me to use the built-in features of LangGraph.js for everything it can be used for before trying to add more nodes or channels or edges to the graph object.

NOTE: my ALL_TOOLS_LIST is not complete at this time: I am refactoring the tool implementation to be contained entirely within the tools.ts file, and will update this section with the complete list of tools once that is complete.

export const ALL_TOOLS_LIST = {
  extractCategory,
  SelectAPITool,
  extractParameters,
  requestParameters,
  createFetchRequest,
  ExtractHighLevelCategories,
};


const assistantModel = new ChatOpenAI({
  model: "gpt-4o-mini",
  temperature: 0
});

const tools: (StructuredToolInterface | RunnableToolLike)[] = [...ALL_TOOLS_LIST];
const toolNodeAtris = new ToolNode(tools);

const modelWithTools = assistantModel.bindTools(tools);

const toolNodeForGraph = new ToolNode(tools);


export type GraphState = {
  /**
   * The LLM to use for the graph
   */
  llm: ChatOpenAI;
  /**
   * The query to extract an API for
   */
  query: string;
  /**
   * The relevant API categories for the query
   */
  categories: string[] | null;
  /**
   * The relevant APIs from the categories
   */
  apis: DatasetSchema[] | null;
  /**
   * The most relevant API for the query
   */
  bestApi: DatasetSchema | null;
  /**
   * The params for the API call
   */
  parameters: Record &lt;string, string&gt; | null;
  /**
   * The API response
   */
  response: Record&lt;string, any&gt; | null;
  /**
   * Is there an error?
   */
  error: boolean;
  /**
   * The messages in state
   */
  messages: string[] | null;
};

const graphChannels = {
  llm: null,
  query: null,
  categories: null,
  apis: null,
  bestApi: null,
  parameters: null,
  response: null,
  error: null,
  stateMessages: null,
};


## Tool Implementation: Node Tools


My approach from here is to use the current tool definitions to get a complete list of tools in my tools.ts file, and I will get a stable, working implementation of this application using the simplified project structure. I will re-modularize the code, or at least attempt to, once I have a working implementation.
