# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js.

## Active Tasks
1. Implement track search functionality.
2. Create a user-friendly CLI interface for interactive testing.
3. Develop error handling and retry mechanisms for improved resilience.
4. Enhance caching strategies for frequently requested data.
5. Implement advanced features like genre-based and mood-based searches.
6. Prepare to integrate frontend components using Next.js.

## Context
Recent progress includes successfully implementing playlist search and retrieval, as well as user search and profile retrieval functionalities. The system now handles queries related to playlists and user profiles, expanding its capabilities beyond trending tracks. We've connected to the Audius discovery nodes via the SDK and integrated these new features into the existing query pipeline.

## Next Steps
1. Focus on implementing advanced track search functionality, including genre and mood filters.
2. Develop a command-line interface for easier interaction and testing.
3. Improve error handling to manage edge cases and unexpected API responses.
4. Implement caching mechanisms to optimize performance for frequent queries.
5. Begin planning for frontend integration using Next.js to provide a user-friendly web interface.
6. Update documentation to reflect new features and changes.
