# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js.

## Active Tasks
1. Resolve any build issues in the project to ensure it compiles successfully.
2. Connect to Audius Discovery Nodes via the SDK.
3. Implement a variety of test queries in `queryHandler.ts`.
4. Develop a readline interface for interactive testing.
5. Refine error handling and response formatting.
6. Expand API coverage to handle more complex queries.
7. Improve user name extraction from queries.
8. Enhance API selection for user-related queries.
9. Implement response sanitization and default timeframe settings for genre queries.
10. Limit genre results to a specified number (defaulting to 5) and remove scores from responses.
11. Set default timeframe to 'week' unless specified otherwise in genre queries.

## Context
Conditional error handling in the graph structure has been implemented, improving the application's flow. The focus is now on resolving build issues and connecting to Audius discovery nodes via the SDK. Recent updates include response sanitization for genre queries and setting default timeframe parameters to enhance user experience. Additionally, we've resolved compiler errors and are now preparing to connect to Audius discovery nodes.

## Next Steps
1. Resolve any build issues to ensure the project compiles successfully.
2. Connect to Audius discovery nodes via the SDK and integrate into existing services.
3. Create comprehensive test queries covering different Audius API functionalities.
4. Implement a readline interface for interactive testing.
5. Analyze and refine responses to complex queries.
6. Identify and handle edge cases.
7. Update documentation to reflect new testing capabilities.
8. Develop playlist and user profile search functionalities.
9. Expand `AudiusApi` class with additional methods.
10. Enhance error handling mechanisms for improved system resilience.
11. Prepare for integration with the frontend using Next.js.
