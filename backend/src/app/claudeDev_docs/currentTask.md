# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js.

## Active Tasks
1. Fix schema validation in extractCategoryTool
2. Implement comprehensive state logging
3. Add state shape validation between nodes
4. Enhance error propagation system
5. Test state reset functionality
6. Document state management patterns

## Context
Recent work has focused on resolving state management issues in the LangGraph implementation. We've identified issues with schema validation, state transitions, and error handling. The system currently fails at the first tool due to schema validation errors, but we've made progress in understanding LangGraph's state management expectations.

## Next Steps
1. Update tool schemas to match LangGraph expectations
2. Implement proper state validation
3. Add comprehensive logging
4. Test state transitions
5. Document working patterns
6. Plan for future memory management
