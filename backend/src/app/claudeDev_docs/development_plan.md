   - Introduce caching for frequently requested data.

5. **Phase 5: Front-end Integration**
   - Create a basic user interface using Next.js for interaction.
   - Develop frontend components to display fetched data.

6. **Phase 6: Design Implementation**
   - Implement detailed design elements and enhance user experience.

7. **Phase 7: Code Cleaning and Documentation**
   - Refine the codebase for efficiency and maintain comprehensive documentation.

8. **Phase 8: Deployment to Production on Vercel**
   - Deploy the application to production using Vercel for scalability and reliability.

## Query Classification System
Implemented in `queryClassifier.ts`, this system categorizes user queries related to Audius.

### Key Features
1. **Contraction Expansion**: Handles queries with contractions effectively.
2. **Enhanced Entity Detection**: Identifies users, tracks, and playlists.
3. **Special Case Handling**: Manages specific query patterns like "Tell me about the user RAC."
4. **Entity Name Refinement**: Cleans entity names by removing extraneous words and punctuation.
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: Ensures proper type annotations for reliability.

### Supported Query Types
- Trending tracks
- User information
- Playlists
- Genre information
- User social data
- Follower counts
- Latest releases
- Track searches
- General platform information

### Recent Developments
1. **Playlist Search and Retrieval**: Implemented functionality to search for playlists and retrieve playlist details.
2. **User Profile Retrieval**: Added the ability to search for users and fetch user profile information.
3. **SDK Integration**: Successfully connected to Audius discovery nodes via the SDK.

## Next Steps
1. Implement advanced track search functionality.
2. Develop the CLI interface for easier testing and interaction.
3. Enhance error handling and introduce retry mechanisms.
4. Implement caching strategies to optimize performance.
5. Begin frontend development with Next.js.
