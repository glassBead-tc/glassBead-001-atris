# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js

## Active Tasks
1. Implement a variety of test queries in queryHandler.ts
2. Develop a readline interface for interactive testing
3. Refine error handling and response formatting
4. Expand API coverage to handle more complex queries
5. Improve user name extraction from queries
6. Enhance API selection for user-related queries

## Context
We have successfully implemented conditional error handling in our graph structure and improved the overall flow of our application. Now, we need to focus on testing various query types and edge cases to ensure our system can handle a wide range of user inputs.

## Next Steps
1. Create a comprehensive set of test queries covering different Audius API functionalities
2. Implement a readline interface for interactive testing
3. Analyze and refine the system's responses to complex queries
4. Identify and implement handling for edge cases
5. Update documentation to reflect new testing capabilities
6. Plan for future enhancements based on test results
