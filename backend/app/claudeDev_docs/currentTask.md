# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js.

## Active Tasks
1. Implement a variety of test queries in `queryHandler.ts`.
2. Develop a readline interface for interactive testing.
3. Refine error handling and response formatting.
4. Expand API coverage to handle more complex queries.
5. Improve user name extraction from queries.
6. Enhance API selection for user-related queries.

## Context
Conditional error handling in the graph structure has been implemented, improving the application's flow. The focus is now on testing diverse query types and edge cases to ensure system robustness.

## Next Steps
1. Create comprehensive test queries covering different Audius API functionalities.
2. Implement a readline interface for interactive testing.
3. Analyze and refine responses to complex queries.
4. Identify and handle edge cases.
5. Update documentation to reflect new testing capabilities.
6. Plan future enhancements based on test outcomes.
