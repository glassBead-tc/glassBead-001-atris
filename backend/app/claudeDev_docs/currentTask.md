# Current Task

## Project Overview
Developing an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js

## Active Tasks
1. Fix API endpoint selection in createFetchRequest function
2. Improve parameter extraction for different query types
3. Update category extraction for genre queries
4. Implement error handling for not-found cases
5. Refine selectApi function for accurate API selection
6. Enhance logging throughout the pipeline

## Context
Recent testing has revealed issues with API endpoint selection, parameter extraction, and query categorization. The system is failing to handle trending tracks, user queries, and genre queries correctly. We need to focus on fixing these core functionalities to ensure accurate responses for all query types.

## Next Steps
1. Review and update all API endpoint selections in createFetchRequest
2. Refactor parameter extraction for each query type
3. Revisit query parsing process, especially for genre queries
4. Implement robust error handling for API request failures
5. Conduct a thorough review of the selectApi function
6. Enhance logging throughout the entire query processing pipeline
7. Verify the accuracy of our documentation against the current codebase
