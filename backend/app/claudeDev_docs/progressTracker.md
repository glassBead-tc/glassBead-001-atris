# Progress Tracker

## Implemented Features
1. Integrated LangGraph.js with Audius API.
2. Extracted categories from user queries.
3. Implemented API selection based on categories and relevance.
4. Enhanced parameter extraction from queries.
5. Improved human-in-the-loop functionality for missing parameters.
6. Robust error handling in API responses.
7. Refined handling of "most followers" queries.
8. Enhanced track search with similarity scoring.
9. Updated components to align with `GraphState` interface.
10. Structured logging across all functions.
11. Abstracted backend logic from user responses.
12. Modularized query handling with `queryHandler`.
13. Improved relevance calculations and API selection.
14. Resolved recursion issues in LangGraph flow.
15. Conducted successful end-to-end testing for entity queries.

## Next Steps
1. Implement caching for frequently requested data.
2. Add support for more Audius API endpoints.
3. Develop a basic user interface for easier interaction.
4. Conduct thorough testing of all updated components.
5. Expand the query handler to support more query types.
6. Create unit tests for the `selectApi` function and its helpers.
7. Optimize relevance calculations for larger API sets.
8. Review and adjust the `RELEVANCE_THRESHOLD` as needed.
9. Ensure proper integration of the updated `selectApi` with other application parts.
10. Enhance documentation for all major components.
11. Improve handling of genre-related queries.
12. Enhance handling of latest releases and trending genres.
13. Develop a sophisticated multi-step query execution system.
14. Implement multi-step processing for user-specific queries.
15. Refine API selection logic for better query-endpoint matching.
16. Improve error handling and user feedback for failed queries.
17. Implement user search functionality before fetching details.
18. Refine response formatting for user-specific queries.
19. Enhance user name extraction for complex artist names.
20. Provide more specific error messages for user queries.
21. Implement fuzzy matching for user searches.
22. Expand `queryClassifier.ts` to handle additional query types.

## Known Issues
1. Some complex queries may still not extract all necessary parameters automatically
2. API selection might not always choose the most appropriate endpoint for edge cases
3. Track search doesn't always find exact matches for less popular or non-existent tracks
4. Genre-related queries are not handled optimally

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement more advanced natural language processing for better query understanding
2. Add support for user context and history in query processing
3. Integrate with other music platforms for comprehensive music information
4. Implement a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement of the system
5. Optimize similarity scoring for better track matching
6. Implement fuzzy search for track and artist names to handle slight misspellings or variations
7. Develop a more sophisticated multi-step query handling system
8. Implement a more robust logging system that separates user-facing logs from internal debugging logs
9. Create a configuration file for easily toggling between development (verbose) and production (user-friendly) logging modes
10. Implement unit and integration tests for all major components
11. Refine type definitions across the application for improved type safety and developer experience
12. Consider implementing a machine learning model for API selection to improve accuracy over time
13. Develop a specialized handler for genre-related queries
14. Implement a mechanism to aggregate and analyze trending genres
15. Develop a more comprehensive error handling and recovery system
16. Implement a system for handling and learning from user feedback on response quality
