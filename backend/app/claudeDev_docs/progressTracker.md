22. Improve user name extraction in query processing
23. Enhance error handling for user search queries
24. Refine API selection process for user-related queries

## Known Issues
1. Some complex queries may still not extract all necessary parameters automatically
2. API selection might not always choose the most appropriate endpoint for edge cases
3. Track search doesn't always find exact matches for less popular or non-existent tracks
4. Genre-related queries are not handled optimally

## Future Enhancements
1. Implement more advanced natural language processing for better query understanding
2. Add support for user context and history in query processing
3. Integrate with other music platforms for comprehensive music information
4. Implement a feedback mechanism for continuous improvement of the system
5. Optimize similarity scoring for better track matching
6. Implement fuzzy search for track and artist names to handle slight misspellings or variations
7. Develop a more sophisticated multi-step query handling system
8. Implement a more robust logging system that separates user-facing logs from internal debugging logs
9. Create a configuration file for easily toggling between development (verbose) and production (user-friendly) logging modes
10. Implement unit and integration tests for all major components
11. Refine type definitions across the application for improved type safety and developer experience
