Reflection: Good progress on core functionality. Need to focus on error handling next.

## Week 2
[██████░░░░] 60%
- Added number parsing for limit queries
- Improved API selection algorithm
- Started work on playlist search

Reflection: Slower progress due to complexities in playlist search. Need to optimize parameter extraction.

## Week 3
[████░░░░░░] 40%
- Implemented multi-query processing in main function
- Updated parseQuery function to handle more query types
