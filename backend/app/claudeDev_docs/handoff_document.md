## Project Overview
This project integrates the Audius API using LangGraph.js and Next.js, enabling natural language queries to access trending tracks, playlists, and user profiles.

## Key Components
1. **Query Processing Pipeline**
2. **API Interaction Layer**
3. **Error Handling and Logging**
4. **Graph Structure for Query Routing**
5. **Documentation and Development Plans**

## Recent Updates
1. **Recursion Issue Resolved**: Fixed an infinite loop in LangGraph by updating `createGraph.ts` to ensure proper flow post API selection.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Implemented detailed logging in `select_api.ts` and other modules for better monitoring and debugging.
3. **Successful Testing**: Completed end-to-end testing for the query "What are the top 5 trending tracks on Audius right now?" with no errors.

## Next Steps
1. Implement playlist and user profile search functionalities.
2. Expand the `AudiusApi` class with additional methods.
3. Develop a basic user interface for improved interaction.
4. Implement caching for frequently requested data.
5. Refine error handling mechanisms for enhanced system resilience.

## Maintenance Guidelines
- **Logging**: Maintain comprehensive logging for all critical operations.
- **Testing**: Regularly update and execute tests to cover new features and edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation current and clear for future developers.
- **Code Reviews**: Conduct regular reviews to ensure code quality and consistency.
