# Handoff Document

## Project Overview
This project is an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js. It processes natural language queries to interact with the Audius API, focusing on trending tracks, playlists, and user profiles.

## Key Components
1. **Query Processing Pipeline**
2. **API Interaction Layer**
3. **Error Handling and Logging**
4. **Graph Structure for Query Routing**
5. **Documentation and Development Plans**

## Recent Updates
1. **Recursion Issue Resolved**: Fixed an infinite loop in the LangGraph flow by updating `createGraph.ts` to ensure entity queries proceed correctly after API selection.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logging in `select_api.ts` and other tools to monitor the flow and assist in debugging.
3. **Successful Testing**: Completed end-to-end testing of the query "What are the top 5 trending tracks on Audius right now?" with successful results and no errors.

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Playlist Search and Retrieval**
2. **Enhance User Profile Search and Retrieval**
3. **Expand AudiusApi Class with New Methods**
4. **Implement Caching for Frequently Requested Data**
5. **Develop a Basic User Interface for Easier Interaction**
6. **Continue Refining Error Handling Mechanisms**
7. **Optimize API Selection Algorithms for Better Relevance**

## Maintenance Guidelines
- **Logging**: Ensure all critical operations continue to have comprehensive logging for monitoring and debugging.
- **Testing**: Regularly update and run tests to cover new features and potential edge cases.
- **Documentation**: Keep all documentation up-to-date with recent changes and ensure clarity for future developers.
- **Code Reviews**: Implement regular code reviews to maintain code quality and consistency.
- **Version Control**: Use git effectively to track changes, manage branches, and handle merges without conflicts.
