# Handoff Document

## Project Overview
This project integrates the Audius API using LangGraph.js and Next.js, enabling natural language queries to access trending tracks, playlists, and user profiles. We have resolved compiler errors and are now focusing on connecting to the Audius discovery nodes via the SDK.

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Agent MVP**
   - Develop the core LangGraph.js agent to handle basic queries.
2. **Phase 2: Front-end MVP**
   - Create a basic user interface using Next.js for interaction.
3. **Phase 3: Design Implementation**
   - Implement detailed design elements and enhance user experience.
4. **Phase 4: Code Cleaning and Documentation**
   - Refine the codebase for efficiency and maintain comprehensive documentation.
5. **Phase 5: Deployment to Production on Vercel**
   - Deploy the application to production using Vercel for scalability and reliability.

## Key Components
1. **Query Processing Pipeline**
2. **API Interaction Layer**
3. **Error Handling and Logging**
4. **Graph Structure for Query Routing**
5. **Documentation and Development Plans**

## Recent Updates
1. **Compiler Errors Resolved**: Fixed TypeScript errors in `audiusApi.ts` and related handler functions.
2. **Connecting to Discovery Nodes**: Initiated the connection to Audius discovery nodes via the SDK.
3. **Recursion Issue Resolved**: Fixed an infinite loop in LangGraph by updating `createGraph.ts` to ensure proper flow post API selection.
4. **Enhanced Logging**: Implemented detailed logging in `select_api.ts` and other modules for better monitoring and debugging.
5. **Successful Testing**: Completed end-to-end testing for the query "What are the top 5 trending tracks on Audius right now?" with no errors.

## Next Steps
1. **Implement Playlist and User Profile Search Functionalities**
2. **Expand the `AudiusApi` Class with Additional Methods**
3. **Develop a Basic User Interface for Improved Interaction**
4. **Implement Caching for Frequently Requested Data**
5. **Refine Error Handling Mechanisms for Enhanced System Resilience**
