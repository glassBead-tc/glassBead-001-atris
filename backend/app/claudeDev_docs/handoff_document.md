## Project Overview
This project is an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js. It processes natural language queries to interact with the Audius API, focusing on trending tracks, playlists, and user profiles.

## Key Components
1. Query Processing Pipeline
2. API Interaction Layer
3. Audius-Specific Functionality
4. Simplified State Management Pipeline
5. Query Classification System

## Current Status
- Basic query pipeline implemented and functioning
- API selection and interaction improved
- Error handling and propagation implemented throughout the graph
- Query classification system introduced for better query routing
- State management pipeline optimized
- Documentation updated to reflect recent changes

## Next Steps
1. Implement playlist search and retrieval
2. Enhance user profile search and retrieval
3. Expand AudiusApi class with new methods
4. Implement caching for frequently requested data
5. Develop a basic user interface for easier interaction

## Important Files
- `backend/app/modules/`: Contains core functionality components
- `backend/app/graph/createGraph.ts`: Defines the main processing pipeline
- `backend/app/modules/queryHandler.ts`: Main entry point for query processing
- `backend/app/modules/select_api.ts`: Contains selectApi function and API selection logic
- `backend/app/modules/queryClassifier.ts`: Handles query type identification and routing

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server with `yarn start`
5. For interactive testing, use `yarn interactive`

## Recent Achievements
- Resolved issues with complex artist name queries
- Implemented modular query handling system
- Improved error handling and user feedback
- Enhanced API selection process
- Created a query classification system

## Current Challenges
- Handling multi-step queries efficiently
- Improving response formatting for various query types
- Optimizing performance for larger sets of API endpoints
- Preparing for integration with Next.js frontend

## Next Development Focus
1. Expand Audius-specific functionality (genre-based search, performer-based search)
2. Enhance API interaction with retry mechanisms and new methods
3. Develop a more sophisticated multi-step query execution system
4. Implement fuzzy matching for user and track searches
5. Create comprehensive unit tests for all major components
