## Project Overview
This project is an Audius API integration system using LangGraph.js and Next.js. It processes natural language queries to interact with the Audius API, focusing on trending tracks, playlists, and user profiles.

## Key Components
1. Query Processing Pipeline
2. API Interaction Layer
3. Audius-Specific Functionality
4. Simplified State Management Pipeline

## Current Status
- Basic query pipeline implemented, but requires refinement
- Some functionality working, but inconsistencies exist
- "No Best API Found" error resolved, but other issues persist
- State management pipeline implemented, but may need optimization
- Documentation may be out of sync with current codebase

## Next Steps
1. Implement playlist search and retrieval
2. Develop user profile search and retrieval
3. Enhance error handling and resilience
4. Expand AudiusApi class with new methods
5. Prepare API routes for future Next.js integration

## Important Files
- `backend/src/tools/`: Contains core functionality components
- `backend/src/graph/createGraph.ts`: Defines the main processing pipeline
- `index.ts`: Main entry point, contains setupTestCases and generateAnswer functions
- `select_api.ts`: Contains selectApi function and API selection logic

## Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `yarn install`
3. Set up environment variables (see `.env.example`)
4. Run the development server with `yarn start`

## Recent Achievements
- Resolved the "No Best API Found" error
- Refactored the project for simpler state management
- Improved API selection and query routing

## Current Challenges
- Optimizing parameter extraction for various query types
- Implementing robust error handling across the system
- Preparing for integration with Next.js frontend

## Next Development Focus
1. Expand Audius-specific functionality (genre-based search, performer-based search)
2. Enhance API interaction with retry mechanisms and new methods
3. Develop a user-friendly CLI interface
4. Implement caching for frequent queries
5. Create comprehensive unit tests for new components
