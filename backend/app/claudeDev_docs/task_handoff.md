## Task Overview

This task involves implementing the functionality to handle the query "What are the most popular genres on Audius?" within our Audius API integration system. This query is classified as a moderate complexity query because it requires additional processing beyond a single API call. The goal is to extract genre information from the trending tracks endpoint, determine the most popular genres based on the frequency of occurrence, limit the results to a specified number (defaulting to 5), and clean up the output by removing score details. Additionally, ensure the default timeframe is set to "week" unless specified otherwise.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Query Classification:**
   - Ensure the query is classified as `genre_info` with a `moderate` complexity level in the `queryClassifier.ts`.

2. **Graph Configuration:**
   - Update the `createAtrisGraph.ts` to route `genre_info` queries to the `handle_multi_step_query` node.

3. **Multi-Step Query Handling:**
   - Implement the logic in `multi_step_queries.ts` to:
     - Fetch data from the `/v1/tracks/trending` endpoint with a default timeframe of 'week'.
     - Extract genres from the fetched tracks.
     - Score and rank genres based on their frequency using Pareto distribution.
     - Limit the results to the top 5 genres unless specified otherwise.
     - Format the top genres into a user-friendly response without including scores.

4. **Response Processing:**
   - Ensure `processApiResponse.ts` formats the response for `genre_info` queries appropriately by limiting results and removing scores.
   - Set the default timeframe to 'week' in the API request if not specified.

## Expected Outcome

Upon completion, the system should be able to process the query "What are the most popular genres on Audius?" by:
- Fetching trending tracks with a default timeframe of 'week'.
- Analyzing genre data and scoring based on frequency.
- Limiting the response to the top 5 genres unless specified otherwise.
- Returning a clean, user-friendly list of top genres without including scores.

## Future Considerations

- **Scalability:** As the system evolves, consider implementing more sophisticated genre analysis techniques, such as incorporating user preferences or historical data trends.
- **Performance Optimization:** Monitor the performance of multi-step queries and optimize data fetching and processing as needed.
- **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback to refine the genre ranking algorithm and improve response accuracy.
