# Task Handoff: Implementing Moderate Complexity Query Handling

## Initial Prompt

I think we should have a short conversation about how we should define complexity, first conceptually, then in code. I'll start, and I'll use our current use case as an example. The query "what are the most popular genres on Audius?" is simple linguistically: it is because we cannot directly access the answer through an endpoint that we have to perform additional work. Here is an analogy to illustrate the scenario: Atris, our research agent, is a studied scholar of Audius. If a user asks her for information that's available directly through an API endpoint, she can respond quickly like a human would if she "knew the answer off the top of her head," or had the answer readily available upon request, the way a studied physicist could tell me who formulated the laws of thermodynamics or why relativistic physics was such a major breakthrough. If our user asks Atris a question that's not directly available through an API endpoint, there is some additional "thinking" required beyond the baseline amount of time it takes to call the API. This amount of "thinking" could be trivial, as in asking our physicist a hypothetical question that his expertise would allow him to easily answer, but would require thinking logically through the problem instead of recalling a fact. That complexity level is comparable to our current situation where we want to determine the most popular genres on Audius in the last week or month, or of all time (our trending tracks endpoint only provides these three windows). However, as in the world of physics or any other, if Atris is to eventually provide insights into Audius with real market value, the agent will eventually need to answer questions that are quite complex. I don't want to implement that functionality yet, but my point is that complexity is a matter of degree, and we should design our solution with the mentality that while single vs multi-step queries are a binary question of whether or not we have an endpoint available to us with all the information needed to answer the query or not, multi-step queries will eventually encompass quite a bit more than single-step queries do, even if that's not the case right now.

I implemented the functionality suggested by the assistant for this, and that's where we're starting from.


## Task Overview

This task involves implementing the functionality to handle the query "What are the most popular genres on Audius?" within our Audius API integration system. This query is classified as a moderate complexity query because it requires additional processing beyond a single API call. The goal is to extract genre information from the trending tracks endpoint and determine the most popular genres based on the frequency of occurrence.

## Implementation Steps

1. **Query Classification:**
   - Ensure the query is classified as `trendingGenres` with a `moderate` complexity level in the `queryClassifier.ts`.

2. **Graph Configuration:**
   - Update the `createAtrisGraph.ts` to route `trendingGenres` queries to the `handle_multi_step_query` node.

3. **Multi-Step Query Handling:**
   - Implement the logic in `multi_step_queries.ts` to:
     - Fetch data from the `/v1/tracks/trending` endpoint.
     - Extract genres from the fetched tracks.
     - Score and rank genres based on their frequency.
     - Format the top genres into a user-friendly response.

4. **Response Processing:**
   - Ensure `processApiResponse.ts` formats the response for `trendingGenres` queries appropriately.

## Expected Outcome

Upon completion, the system should be able to process the query "What are the most popular genres on Audius?" by:
- Fetching trending tracks.
- Analyzing genre data.
- Returning the top 5 genres based on frequency.

## Future Considerations

- **Scalability:** As the system evolves, consider implementing more sophisticated genre analysis techniques, such as incorporating user preferences or historical data trends.
- **Performance Optimization:** Monitor the performance of multi-step queries and optimize data fetching and processing as needed.
- **User Feedback:** Gather user feedback to refine the genre ranking algorithm and improve response accuracy.

## Conclusion

This task enhances the system's ability to handle moderate complexity queries, paving the way for more advanced query processing capabilities in the future. By implementing this functionality, we ensure that Atris can provide users with valuable insights into genre popularity on Audius.
