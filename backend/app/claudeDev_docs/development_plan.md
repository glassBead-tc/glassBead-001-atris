# Development Plan

## Development Phases
1. **Phase 1: Agent MVP**
   - Develop the core LangGraph.js agent to handle basic queries.
2. **Phase 2: Front-end MVP**
   - Create a basic user interface using Next.js for interaction.
3. **Phase 3: Design Implementation**
   - Implement detailed design elements and enhance user experience.
4. **Phase 4: Code Cleaning and Documentation**
   - Refine the codebase for efficiency and maintain comprehensive documentation.
5. **Phase 5: Deployment to Production on Vercel**
   - Deploy the application to production using Vercel for scalability and reliability.

## Query Classification System
Implemented in `queryClassifier.ts`, this system categorizes user queries related to Audius.

### Key Features
1. **Contraction Expansion**: Handles queries with contractions effectively.
2. **Enhanced Entity Detection**: Identifies users, tracks, and playlists.
3. **Special Case Handling**: Manages specific query patterns like "Tell me about the user RAC."
4. **Entity Name Refinement**: Cleans entity names by removing extraneous words and punctuation.
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: Ensures proper type annotations for reliability.

### Supported Query Types
- Trending tracks
- User information
- Playlists
- Genre information
- User social data
- Follower counts
- Latest releases
- Track searches
- General platform information

### Recent Developments
1. **Compiler Errors Resolved**: Fixed TypeScript errors in `audiusApi.ts` and related handler functions.
2. **Resolved Recursion Issue**: Fixed infinite loops in LangGraph by updating `createGraph.ts` to prevent entity queries from looping.
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logs in `select_api.ts` and other tools for better debugging.
4. **Connecting to Discovery Nodes**: Initiated the connection to Audius discovery nodes via the SDK.
5. **Successful Testing**: Completed end-to-end tests confirming the resolution of recursion issues and accurate query processing.

## Next Steps
1. **Phase 2: Front-end MVP**
   - Develop the basic user interface with Next.js.
   - Connect the frontend to the AudiusApi service.
2. **Implement Playlist and User Profile Search Functionalities**
3. **Expand `AudiusApi` Class with Additional Methods**
4. **Implement Caching for Frequently Requested Data**
5. **Refine Error Handling Mechanisms for Enhanced System Resilience**
6. **Prepare for Deployment to Production on Vercel**
7. **Develop Detailed Design Elements and Enhance User Experience**
8. **Code Cleaning and Comprehensive Documentation**
