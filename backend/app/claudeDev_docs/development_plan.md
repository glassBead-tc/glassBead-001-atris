# Development Plan

## Query Classification System

We have successfully implemented and refined the query classification system in the `queryClassifier.ts` file. This system is crucial for understanding and processing user queries related to the Audius platform.

### Key Features

1. **Contraction Expansion**: Implemented to handle queries with contractions more effectively.
2. **Enhanced Entity Detection**: Improved for various types of queries, including user, track, and playlist queries.
3. **Special Case Handling**: Added for specific query patterns, such as "Tell me about the user RAC" and "How many followers does Deadmau5 have?".
4. **Entity Name Refinement**: Improved logic for removing extra words and question marks from entity names.
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: Addressed TypeScript errors by adding proper type annotations.

### Supported Query Types

The system now successfully handles the following types of queries:
- Trending tracks queries
- User information queries
- Playlist queries
- Genre information queries
- User social queries (most followed artists)
- Follower count queries
- Latest release queries
- Search track queries
- General queries about the Audius platform

### Next Steps

1. Integrate the query classification system with the main application flow.
2. Develop response generation based on the classified query types.
3. Implement error handling for edge cases and unexpected query formats.
4. Conduct thorough testing with a wider range of real-world queries.
5. Optimize performance for large-scale query processing.
