# Development Plan

## Recent Accomplishments

1. Improved Audius API Integration
   - Enhanced search query construction in `extract_parameters.ts`
   - Upgraded result processing in `process_api_response.ts`
   - Implemented closest match feature using Levenshtein distance algorithm
   - Improved handling of capitalization and punctuation in artist and track names
   - Enhanced user experience with more detailed and informative responses

2. Resolved Issues
   - Fixed inaccurate "artist + track name" matching
   - Improved handling of cases where exact matches are not found

## Short-term Goals

1. Implement additional error handling and edge case scenarios
   - Identify potential edge cases in user queries
   - Develop robust error handling for API failures or unexpected responses

2. Optimize performance for large result sets
   - Profile the current implementation to identify bottlenecks
   - Implement pagination or lazy loading for large result sets

3. Expand test coverage
   - Develop unit tests for new functionality in `extract_parameters.ts` and `process_api_response.ts`
   - Create integration tests for the entire search flow

## Mid-term Goals

1. Integrate with additional Audius API endpoints
   - Research other useful Audius API endpoints
   - Plan and implement integration with selected endpoints

2. Improve search algorithm
   - Investigate advanced search techniques (e.g., fuzzy matching, phonetic algorithms)
   - Implement and test improvements to the search functionality

3. Enhance user interface for search results
   - Design and implement a more user-friendly way to display search results
   - Add features like sorting and filtering of results

## Long-term Goals

1. Develop a comprehensive Audius integration ecosystem
   - Create a roadmap for full Audius platform integration
   - Plan and implement features that leverage Audius's unique capabilities

2. Implement user feedback system
   - Design and implement a system for collecting user feedback on search results
   - Use collected data to continually improve search algorithms and user experience

3. Explore AI-powered features
   - Research potential AI applications in music discovery and recommendation
   - Prototype and test AI-enhanced features that complement Audius integration
