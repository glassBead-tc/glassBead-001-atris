# Development Plan

## Current Focus: Implementing Multi-Step Queries

### Short-term Goals
1. Implement multi-step query handling
   - Identify common multi-step query scenarios for Audius data
   - Design a mechanism to break down complex queries into multiple steps
   - Implement chaining of multiple API calls
   - Update the graph structure to accommodate multi-step processing
   - Enhance response processing to synthesize information from multiple API calls

2. Refine API response processing
   - Implement more sophisticated answer generation based on multi-step query results
   - Handle cases where multiple API calls are necessary to answer a query

3. Expand API coverage
   - Integrate more Audius API endpoints to support multi-step queries
   - Implement more sophisticated API selection logic for complex queries

### Medium-term Goals
1. Implement caching
   - Add a caching layer for frequently requested data to improve response times
2. Develop a basic user interface
   - Create a simple web interface for interacting with the LangGraph system
3. Enhance natural language processing
   - Improve query parsing to better handle complex and multi-step queries

### Long-term Goals
1. Advanced natural language processing
   - Implement more advanced NLP techniques for better query understanding and parameter extraction
2. User personalization
   - Implement user profiles and personalized responses based on user history and preferences
3. Integration with other music platforms
   - Explore possibilities of integrating with other music APIs to provide comprehensive music information

### Ongoing Tasks
1. Regular code refactoring and optimization
2. Continuous testing and bug fixing
3. Documentation updates
4. Performance monitoring and optimization
