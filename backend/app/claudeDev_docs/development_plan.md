# Development Plan

## Query Classification System

We have successfully implemented and refined the query classification system in the `queryClassifier.ts` file. This system is crucial for understanding and processing user queries related to the Audius platform.

### Key Features

1. **Contraction Expansion**: Implemented to handle queries with contractions more effectively.
2. **Enhanced Entity Detection**: Improved for various types of queries, including user, track, and playlist queries.
3. **Special Case Handling**: Added for specific query patterns, such as "Tell me about the user RAC" and "How many followers does Deadmau5 have?".
4. **Entity Name Refinement**: Improved logic for removing extra words and question marks from entity names.
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: Addressed TypeScript errors by adding proper type annotations.

### Supported Query Types

- Trending tracks
- User information
- Playlists
- Genre information
- User social data
- Follower counts
- Latest releases
- Track searches
- General platform information

### Recent Developments

1. **Resolved Recursion Issue**: Fixed the infinite loop in LangGraph flow by updating `createGraph.ts` to prevent entity queries from routing back to `handle_entity_query`.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Implemented more detailed logging in `select_api.ts` and other tools to facilitate easier debugging and monitoring.
3. **Successful Testing**: Conducted end-to-end tests confirming the resolution of the recursion issue and ensuring that queries are processed as intended.

### Future Enhancements

1. **Expand Query Types**: Continue to identify and support additional query types based on user feedback and platform features.
2. **Optimize API Selection**: Refine the relevance calculation algorithm to improve the accuracy of API selection.
3. **Improve Error Handling**: Implement more granular error messages and handling mechanisms to cover a broader range of potential issues.
4. **User Feedback Integration**: Incorporate user feedback to prioritize feature development and improve the overall system.

### Development Phases

1. **Phase 1: Stabilization**
   - Fix existing issues such as the recursion problem.
   - Ensure all current features work seamlessly.

2. **Phase 2: Feature Expansion**
   - Add support for additional query types.
   - Enhance API interaction capabilities.

3. **Phase 3: Optimization**
   - Optimize performance and scalability.
   - Refine algorithms for better efficiency.

4. **Phase 4: User Interface Development**
   - Develop frontend components for better user interaction.
   - Implement a user-friendly interface for query input and response display.

5. **Phase 5: Documentation and Handover**
   - Complete comprehensive documentation.
   - Prepare handoff documents for future development and maintenance.
