# Development Plan

## Query Classification System
Implemented in `queryClassifier.ts`, this system categorizes user queries related to Audius.

### Key Features
1. **Contraction Expansion**: Handles queries with contractions effectively.
2. **Enhanced Entity Detection**: Identifies users, tracks, and playlists.
3. **Special Case Handling**: Manages specific query patterns like "Tell me about the user RAC."
4. **Entity Name Refinement**: Cleans entity names by removing extraneous words and punctuation.
5. **TypeScript Compliance**: Ensures proper type annotations for reliability.

### Supported Query Types
- Trending tracks
- User information
- Playlists
- Genre information
- User social data
- Follower counts
- Latest releases
- Track searches
- General platform information

### Recent Developments
1. **Resolved Recursion Issue**: Fixed infinite loops in LangGraph by updating `createGraph.ts` to prevent entity queries from looping.
2. **Enhanced Logging**: Added detailed logs in `select_api.ts` and other tools for better debugging.
3. **Successful Testing**: Completed end-to-end tests confirming the resolution of recursion issues and accurate query processing.

### Future Enhancements
1. **Expand Query Types**: Support additional query types based on user feedback.
2. **Optimize API Selection**: Improve the relevance calculation algorithm for more accurate API selections.
