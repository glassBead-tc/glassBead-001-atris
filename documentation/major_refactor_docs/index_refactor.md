# index.ts Refactor

## Objective

Refactor `index.ts` to align with LangChain's best practices, integrating the refactored tools and ensuring proper state management.

## Steps

1. **Integrate `executeTools`:**  
   Replace manual tool execution with calls to the refactored `executeTools` function, which now returns `Partial<GraphState>`.

2. **Initialize LLM Correctly:**  
   Ensure that the `ChatOpenAI` instance is correctly instantiated with necessary configurations and passed into the `GraphState`.

3. **Update GraphState Initialization:**  
   Initialize `GraphState` with `initialGraphState` and merge with specific query details.

4. **Handle Tool Execution Results:**  
   After calling `executeTools`, merge the returned partial state into the main state and handle errors appropriately.

5. **Enhance Logging:**  
   Implement detailed logging at each step of the tool execution for better traceability.

6. **Testing:**  
   Write integration tests to validate that `index.ts` correctly orchestrates the tool execution and handles responses.

## Status

- [X] Step 1
- [ ] Step 2
- [ ] Step 3
- [ ] Step 4
- [ ] Step 5
- [ ] Step 6

## Challenges

- Ensuring seamless integration between `executeTools` and the main application flow.
- Maintaining consistency in state updates and error handling.

## Notes

- Review the flow of data through `executeTools` to ensure that all necessary state updates are captured.
- Coordinate with other refactoring tasks to ensure that tool interfaces remain consistent.
