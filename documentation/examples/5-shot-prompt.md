# 🎵 Audius Technical Documentation Assistant Implementation

> A systematic approach to enhancing the Audius protocol documentation assistant through a 5-shot implementation strategy.

## 🏗️ Foundation
The core system has been built with:

- **Framework**: Next.js with TypeScript
- **Vector Store**: Supabase with pgvector
- **Agent Framework**: LangGraph with research-driven architecture
- **Document Management**: Advanced vector storage and retrieval

## 🎯 Implementation Path

### 🔍 Shot 1: Research-Driven Query Resolution ✅
Core agent architecture implemented with:

- ✅ StateGraph-based workflow
- ✅ Type-safe state management
- ✅ Research-driven query resolution
- ✅ Router, Research, Clarify, and Respond nodes
- ✅ Advanced document retrieval with Supabase

### 📚 Shot 2: Enhanced Document Processing ✅
Building upon our document system with:

- ✅ Advanced metadata filtering
- ✅ Version-aware document retrieval
- ✅ Document relationship mapping
- ✅ Source validation and tracking
- ✅ Protocol context awareness

**Recent Achievements**:
