## Iterative Documentation 2: Project Cleanup One

We will be providing short, descriptive summaries (think git commit messages) of our progress with each successive edit. We will group edits into sections that correspond to the time we spend working between runs of the program, and runs of the program into sections that correspond to the time we spend between terminal runs or "windows" of work.

(notes to assistant: 

1. If you do not have access to the current GMT/UTC time, do not use timestamps in your entries, they will be added by the human. If you do, please put a timestamp with the current time in UTC format. 
2. After updating the documentation, clear your context window of all project files to allow for maximum ease of cognition, and let the human know you did this in the chat.
3. If this file has been added to your context window in relation to an error, please review the document for relevant material, but do not assume all material is relevant by default: a great many things may be documented in an itD file.
4. Your updates should provide exact "to" and "from" code snippets when updates are less than 10 lines, and condensed snippets when between 10 and 30 lines. If the update is more than 30 lines, please provide a summary of "to" and "from" changes.

## Start

### 2024-02-14 - Documentation Structure Reorganization
1. Created new documentation hierarchy:
   - Categorized subfolders for different documentation types
   - Separated persistent errors from refactors
   - Established consistent naming convention
   - Created templates based on successful docs

2. Key Changes:
   - Moved error documentation to `/persistent_errors`
   - Created `/refactors` for cleanup and improvements
   - Maintained existing successful doc structures
   - Added template for future documentation

### 2024-02-14 - Web Documentation Integration
1. Created new documentation files:
   - Added `src/app/tooling_documentation/web_docs/audius_sdk.md`
   - Centralized API documentation references
   - Established single source of truth for endpoints
   - Improved accessibility of reference materials

2. Documentation Focus:
   - API endpoint references
   - SDK implementation guides
   - Authentication requirements
   - Response format specifications

3. Benefits:
   - Faster development cycles
   - Reduced context switching
   - Improved accuracy in implementation
   - Better error handling guidance

## Analysis Sections

### 1. Documentation Structure Analysis
1. Previous State:
   - Scattered documentation
   - Inconsistent formats
   - Duplicate information
   - Hard to find references

2. New Structure:
   - Categorized by purpose
   - Consistent formatting
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Easy reference access

3. Impact:
   - Faster development
   - Better organization
   - Clearer communication
   - Improved maintenance

### 2. Web Documentation Analysis
1. Key Components:
   - API endpoints
   - Authentication methods
   - Request/response formats
   - Error handling

2. Benefits:
   - Single source of truth
   - Reduced errors
   - Faster implementation
   - Better debugging

## End
