# Session History and Insights

## Key Developments
1. **State Management Understanding**
   - Discovered LangGraph's true purpose: abstracting state management
   - Identified cyclical debugging pattern
   - Verified correct tool implementation approach
   - Documented fallacious reasoning patterns

2. **Implementation Journey**
   - Started with full state management
   - Moved to partial input
   - Attempted input mapping
   - Returned to simpler approach
   - Verified with framework source

3. **Documentation Structure**
   - Created reasoning folder for patterns
   - Established solution template
   - Documented fallacious logic
   - Created rules of thumb

## Key Insights
1. **LLM Behavior Patterns**
   - Tendency to focus on immediate error
   - Previous context becomes background
   - Solutions treated atomically
   - Pattern recognition needs prompting

2. **Framework Understanding**
   - LangGraph handles state distribution
   - Tools should be simple and focused
   - Schema validation is built-in
   - Framework design is intentional

3. **Development Process**
   - Context window management is crucial
   - Documentation should be task-specific
   - Error analysis needs structure
   - Pattern recognition aids debugging

## Current Status
1. **Implementation**
   - Using tool decorator pattern
   - Direct node addition
   - Clean state management
   - Working schema validation

2. **Documentation**
   - Comprehensive analysis in place
   - Clear development history
   - Pattern recognition tools
   - Process improvements documented

3. **Next Steps**
   - Continue with current approach
   - Monitor state transitions
   - Document new patterns
   - Build on current understanding
