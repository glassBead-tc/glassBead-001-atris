# Solution Pattern Template

## Quick Checks
1. **Framework First**
   - [ ] Read source code for relevant feature
   - [ ] Check official examples
   - [ ] Note design philosophy

2. **Error Analysis**
   - [ ] Full error message
   - [ ] Recent changes
   - [ ] Similar past errors

3. **Assumptions Check**
   - [ ] List all assumptions
   - [ ] Verify each one
   - [ ] Question necessity

## Key Questions
1. **Framework**
   ```typescript
   - Built-in solution available?
   - Fighting the framework?
   - Simplest approach?
   ```

2. **Dependencies**
   ```typescript
   - Who owns this responsibility?
   - Is manual handling needed?
   - What are real dependencies?
   ```

3. **Patterns**
   ```typescript
   - Seen this before?
   - What worked/didn't?
   - What's different now?
   ```

## Implementation
1. **Changes**
   - Smallest possible change
   - Test framework features first
   - Document why needed

2. **Validation**
   - Test original error
   - Check for new issues
   - Verify framework fit

3. **Review**
   - Root cause addressed?
   - Could be simpler?
   - Future impacts?
